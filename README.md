## First reunion: 28.03
For next time (4.04): 
- Read the official report of the UEFA about EURO 2020: https://adobeindd.com/view/publications/6e8ce3d6-ff21-4d31-be78-50651ff1ad3e/hnak/publication-web-resources/pdf/EURO2020_Tech_Report_SCREEN_EN.pdf
- Read the reports sent by Angel's friend. These ones over here: https://fbref.com/en/matches/799efcfc/Croatia-Spain-June-28-2021-UEFA-Euro  https://www.whoscored.com/Matches/1553537/MatchReport/International-European-Championship-2020-Croatia-Spain
- Write ideas on this file (README.md) about topics that we should treat 
- Make pairs to address 4 topics in total 


## Second reunion: 4.03
Preparation: 
List of topics we could treat: 
- Tristan
  - Creative analysis: 
    - Pre-match analysis: formations, number of goals scored in competition so far, player that run most, preferentials playing schemes, way of playing (counter attack, possession ...), when they use to score goals (first 20mins, first half, ...).   
    - Analysing why the game has had so many goals. Was it predictibible? 
    - Importance of coaching: 2 goals of Croatia were scored by substitutes. 
    - Focus on the palyer of the match: Sergio Busquets (official). But we can also analyse "our" man of the match (Torres or Pedri, no no I'm not a barca fan haha).  
  - Traditional Analysis: 
    - General overview (like the thing that is already done in every applications to see number of shots, yellow cards...) 
    - Make duels: Modric vs Busquets
    - Passes: Networks of pass, passing sequences (ABA, ABAC...), Directions of passing (it would be nice to see if this trend changes depending on the score of the match)
    - Shots: maps of all shots, expected goals
  - Tools: The gitlab contains a lot of tutorials to create graphs (passing networks, xG): https://gitlab.ethz.ch/socceranalytics/uefa-euro-2020/-/wikis/Data-and-Tools
- Martí
  - Comparison between statistics of the each team in the whole competition and this particular match.
  - Discuss the different amount of completed passes of each team and analyse if it had a direct impact on possession, shots and goals.
  - A creative thing would be to come up with a score for each player to pick the best player of the match objectively. I don't know if we can use other games' statistics for this.
  - I would also like to see the real played time in this game, and if the % of played time respect the real time decreases as the game progresses (tiredness, a team losing time, etc.)

- Angel
  - I would try to integrate everything mentioned above. More specifically, I like the approach of dividing the analysis in traditional/creative.
  - Traditional approach: the "must-have". 
    For this part I would use the tools shown in gitlab that Tristan linked (https://gitlab.ethz.ch/socceranalytics/uefa-euro-2020/-/wikis/Data-and-Tools). There's a time limitation here: the tools are realesed parallely to lectures. Thus, we will not have access to the tools for the latest lectures until the end of the course. With this in mind, I would divide the traditional approach in two phases:
    Phase 1: everything from week 3 to week 6 (scores, running, passing, shooting). Every subgroup would then be in charge of one of the 4 sections of this phase. The idea would be starting this part this week already and have something prepared by Easter (?).
    Phase 2: all the collective and environment topics (that we'll see in April - May). Again, we'd divide the work in 4 subsections. 
  - Creative approach: the "nice-to-have".
    After having done the phase 1 of the traditional approach, I would proceed with the creative part. I like very much some of the ideas you guys mentioned: 
    i) Pre and Post-match analysis: comparison on how different this match has been with respect all others of the competition for both teams.
    ii) In-game analysis: see how changes affected. Maybe add what could've happened if other changes were made? I feel this is a very very interesting part as real teams working with AI are hightly interested in evaluating how data analytics can help in doing in-match substitutions.
    iii) Player of the match/individual scores. Also very interesting. This could be our "signature". It'd may be a significant achievement if we develop a consistent system for player scoring focusing on objective statistics.
    iv) Predictability of the match. How predictable was this weird result happened? Also like this approach but I feel it may be a bit vague. Predictability of a match as a whole may be too much for the scope of our work
  
 - Lluís
  - Effect of changes in the game.
  - Create our own ratings of the players and compare them to the ones that are published in different media.
  - Deffensive mistakes: Why did Spain commit the first error? Was it due by full preassure? Why Spain conceeded 2 goals in the last 7 minutes?
  - It would be cool to create some "probabilities of this shoot to actually be a goal" as Microsoft does.
